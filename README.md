# Traffic Light – Interactive Web Mini-Project

A clean, interactive **traffic light simulation** built using core web technologies to demonstrate practical front-end development skills and implementation of timed UI behavior.

---

## Project Overview

This mini-project simulates a standard traffic light signal system with **Red, Yellow, and Green light cycles**. It showcases:

* **Timed state transitions**
* DOM interaction using JavaScript
* Responsive UI updates
* Clean separation of structure, style, and logic

This project serves as a **demonstrative portfolio piece** for frontend competency in building dynamic UI components.

## Core Technologies

* **HTML5** — Semantic structure
* **CSS3** — Visual design and layout
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Logic, state transitions, and DOM manipulation
* **Event-Driven Updates** — Simulating real-world interactive behavior
